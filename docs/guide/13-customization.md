# Customization

AI-DLC is designed to adapt to your team's needs. This chapter covers settings overrides, scope configuration, stage customization, statusline, and tool permissions.

> **Harness-specific config.** The harness-neutral customizations — scope

> mechanism-level config in this chapter (`settings.json` / `settings.local.json`,
> the statusline command, `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, tool-permission blocks) is
> **Claude Code-specific**. Kiro CLI configures the equivalents in

## Settings Overrides (`settings.local.json`)

The shared `.claude/settings.json` ships with the framework and is committed to version control. To override settings for your local environment without affecting the team, create a personal overrides file:

```bash
cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
```

This file is listed in `.gitignore` so your personal changes are never committed. Use it to:

- Override model selection (e.g., switch to a different Opus or Sonnet model ID)
- Set environment variables for your local setup
- Adjust tool permissions for your security requirements

---

## Agent Models and Effort (Tiers)

Shipped agents are authored with a `tier:` (`judgment` | `balanced` | `templated`) that the build projects into each harness's native model/effort keys. With no recorded model policy, judgment and templated agents inherit your session's model and effort; only the balanced reviewer tier pins a mid-size model at `medium` effort on Claude Code, Codex, and opencode. On Kiro, Cursor, and Copilot all tiers inherit the session model and effort. See [Agent System](../reference/05-agent-system.md) for the full shipped projection table.

The first-run wizard defaults to the `balanced` **preset**, which is distinct
from the reviewer **tier**: it records medium effort for all three groups.
Select a preset with `aidlc config models --preset balanced --project --yes`:

| Preset | Deciding | Reviewing | Writing up |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| `thorough` | session effort | `xhigh` | session effort |
| `balanced` | `medium` | `medium` | `medium` |
| `minimal` | `medium` | `medium` | `low` |

Presets set effort only, never model IDs. Per-agent exceptions override group
dials, which override shipped tier defaults. Kiro CLI/IDE, Cursor, and Copilot
cannot express these group effort dials; the policy is recorded and reported
as unexpressed rather than written as inert keys. See
[Model Policy](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#model-policy) for profiles, overrides,
and the upgrade path.

To change ONE agent's behavior in your installed copy, edit the projected value directly — for example, set `model: opus` in a Claude agent's `.claude/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md` frontmatter. On Kiro the surface depends on the harness: on Kiro CLI add a `"model"` field to the agent's `.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.json`, and on Kiro IDE set a `model:` line in the agent's `.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md` frontmatter (the agent JSON files are CLI-only — the IDE reads the `.md` frontmatter when spawning). In both cases use a model ID enabled on your install; Kiro agents ship without a model pin so they inherit the session model by default. The edit survives until `aidlc config` refreshes that framework-owned file or you manually replace it from the same versioned `runtime/<harness>/` release payload. To cap EVERY agent when building your own distribution from source, set a `tier_cap:` in `core/memory/org.md`/`project.md` frontmatter or run the packager with `AIDLC_TIER_CAP=<tier>` — both are pack-time knobs on `bun scripts/package.ts`, not runtime settings.

---

## Per-Project Default Scope

When every workflow in a project should start at the same scope, set `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` in the `env` block of `.claude/settings.json` (the shipped file already has this set to `classic`, matching the framework's hard-coded fallback — set it to `feature` to run the full lifecycle by default):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE": "feature"
  }
}
```

> The shipped `env` block also contains Bedrock model IDs (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, etc.). Those are listed separately — the example above only shows the scope key for clarity.

With this set, implicit scope resolution uses `feature`. Alternatively, record a project default with `aidlc config flags --default-scope feature --project --yes` (or `--local` for this checkout). The real `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` environment variable wins over the recorded flag; the shipped settings env entry therefore remains authoritative until you change or remove that entry. Once the intent's `aidlc-state.md` exists (under its record dir), its scope is authoritative and changes to the implicit default do not alter an in-flight workflow.

**Precedence (highest to lowest):**

1. Explicit CLI flag: `/aidlc feature` or `/aidlc --scope bugfix` wins.
2. Keyword detection in freeform text: `/aidlc fix the login bug` still maps to `bugfix`. Users can override the detected scope at the existing confirmation prompt.
3. The real `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` environment variable, including the value supplied by `.claude/settings.json`.
4. The recorded `aidlc config flags --default-scope` value (local settings override shared project settings).
5. `classic` — the framework fallback used by unmatched-freeform resolution,
   `/aidlc-init`, and direct `intent-create` calls without `--scope`.

**Valid values:** `enterprise`, `feature`, `mvp`, `poc`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `infra`, `security-patch`, `classic`, `workshop`, `express`. An invalid value errors at invocation time with a clear message. Teams can define additional scopes by dropping a `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` file and tagging the member stages' `scopes:` lists — see [Contributing: Adding a Scope](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-a-scope). Teams can also define additional agents in `.claude/agents/` — see [Contributing: Adding an Agent](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-an-agent).

**Verifying the config:** run `/aidlc --doctor` to confirm the configured default scope is valid (environment and recorded defaults share this check):

```
✓  AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE=classic (valid)
```

**Init notice:** when the env default is applied, the orchestrator prints a one-line notice at workflow start (`Using scope=<value> from AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE (.claude/settings.json)`) so the scope source is visible at the moment it takes effect.

Why only scope and not depth or test-strategy? Each scope declares a depth, and test strategy inherits that depth unless the scope overrides it. `classic` therefore starts at Standard/Standard, `workshop` at Standard/Minimal, and `express` at Minimal/Minimal. If you need to override either, pass `--depth` or `--test-strategy` on the CLI.

**Sensitive values:** `.claude/settings.json` is committed to version control. Don't put secrets, credentials, or personal overrides here — use `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) for anything sensitive.

---

## Scope Configuration

Scopes control which stages execute and at what depth and test strategy. AI-DLC provides 11 named scopes; the full table (EXECUTE/total stage counts, default depth, test strategy, and use case for each) is the single source in [Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy § The 11 Core Scopes](05-scopes-and-depth.md#the-11-core-scopes). This section covers *configuring* and overriding them.

### Choosing a scope

Specify explicitly or let the orchestrator auto-detect:

```
/aidlc enterprise       # Explicit scope
/aidlc Build a payments API  # No keyword: offers composition; resolver fallback is "classic"
/aidlc Fix the login bug     # Auto-detects "bugfix"
```

### Overriding at runtime

You can override scope at any time during a workflow:

- **At any approval gate**: request a different scope or depth
- **Via utility command**: `/aidlc --scope enterprise` changes the active scope
- **Stage inclusion**: at approval gates in Ideation and Inception, you can add a previously skipped stage back into the workflow

---

## Intent Configuration

The seven intent settings are `depth`, `test-strategy`, `review`,
`guard-policy`, `sensors`, `learnings`, and `summary-confirmation`, in that
order. Five more keys, `guard.plan-approval`, `guard.review-freeze`,
`guard.state-transition`, `guard.reviewer-scope`, and `guard.human-presence`,
switch one guard off or back on for a single piece of work. They all use one
atomic setter, `config-change`; the slash flags and `config set` routes are front
ends to that same operation. Mix settings in one command rather than chaining
separate updates:

```
/aidlc --depth standard --test-strategy minimal --review advisory --guard-policy relaxed --sensors off --learnings on --summary-confirmation off
/aidlc config set guard-policy strict --sensors on --learnings on
/aidlc --scope bugfix --review none --guard-policy relaxed --sensors off
```

The native equivalent is `aidlc engine config set <key> <value>` followed by
the remaining `--key value` flags. `config get <key>` accepts all twelve keys,
and `config list` (optionally `--json`) returns all twelve, including effective
values and sources for Guard Policy, the five fences, and the ceremonies:

```
/aidlc config get guard-policy
/aidlc config get guard.plan-approval
/aidlc config get summary-confirmation
/aidlc config list --json
```

`config-change` accepts only those setting flags and `--intent`, `--space`,
`--project-dir` selectors, with at least one setting required. For example:

```bash
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-utility.ts config-change --guard-policy relaxed --sensors off --intent login-fix --space platform --project-dir /work/shop
```

Selectors target the same intent for state, memory policy, and audit without
switching the active cursors. All supplied values are validated before mutation;
invalid values or unknown flags refuse the whole update, naming the offending
flag. A memory-enforced strict policy refuses an explicit `relaxed` or `off`
Guard Policy setting together with every companion setting and scope change.
Explicit strict and unrelated settings remain allowed. One lock covers the state read, shared
applier, complete audit batch, and single state write; an audit failure leaves
state untouched. `Last Updated` changes only for a real stored change, including
a provenance change. Repeating the same stored choice is a no-op.

Scope changes accept the same flags and use the same applier. A
same-as-current scope still applies supplied settings. The scope-owned Guard
Policy and ceremony rows track new scope defaults, while explicit human
overrides and absent legacy rows are preserved. Under strict memory policy,
an implicit scope change still updates the scope-owned Guard Policy line;
memory continues to control the effective value. Explicit flags take precedence over scope defaults and record
human provenance. `review adversarial` clears the `Review Override` field to an
empty string, so stage declarations and scope review caps still apply.

### Ceremony Switches

Scopes own three independent ceremony defaults. Each accepts `on` or `off`.
Every shipped scope now declares all three explicitly rather than relying on a
default; a scope file that omits one still falls back to `on`. Classic sets
sensors and learnings to `on` and summary confirmation to `off`. Express is the
only shipped scope with all three off.

| Scope key | Per-intent flag | Global kill switch | What off removes |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| `sensors` | `/aidlc --sensors on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS=1` | Sensor runs and their gate checks |
| `learnings` | `/aidlc --learnings on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_LEARNINGS=1` | Stage learnings read/write ritual |
| `summary_confirmation` | `/aidlc --summary-confirmation on\|off` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION=1` | The separate pre-output summary-confirmation checkpoint |

Precedence is global kill switch (`1`) → valid intent field → scope default →
`on`. Kill switches can also be recorded with `aidlc config flags --bypass <NAME>`.
New intents store `Sensors`, `Learnings`, and `Summary Confirmation` after
`Guard Policy` in `aidlc-state.md`, each with a source label such as
`on (from scope classic)`. A flag changes the label to `set by you` and
records `CEREMONY_SET`. `/aidlc --status` shows the effective value and source.
Changing scope updates scope-sourced settings while keeping your overrides;
an absent or malformed field falls back to the scope instead of blocking the run.

These switches do not remove approval gates, Plan Approval, human-turn
authority, audit, or team cross-unit write protection. Classic turns off
walking-skeleton ceremony and caps gated-flow reviews at advisory; explicit autonomy retains
the single pre-merge review.

An isolated `--single` attempt uses its selected scope's policy rather than
the main intent's ceremony overrides. That scope is recorded on the synthetic
stage-start event and remains fixed through completion; resume with a different
scope is refused. Legacy isolated starts without a recorded scope retain
summary confirmation and do not enforce this scope comparison.

### Guard Policy

Guard Policy is one setting with three values, `strict`, `relaxed`, and `off`. It decides how far the framework's guards stand aside for the piece of work you are on. It covers two things: what happens when something you already approved turns out to have changed underneath, and how hard the five fences hold against work nobody asked for.

**When an approved input changed.** The source files moved after you approved a code plan, a reviewed document was edited after its review, or an output was saved without the current summary confirmation.

- `strict` reopens the approval. The run stops with one plain sentence naming what changed (for example `2 files changed since this plan was approved: src/api.ts, src/db.ts. Look them over and approve the plan again to continue.`) and asks you again.
- `relaxed` and `off` keep going. The change is recorded once in the audit trail as a `CHANGE_ACCEPTED` row, you hear one line about it (`... Continuing (Guard Policy: relaxed or off). Say 'review the plan again' to reopen approval.`), and the run continues. Nothing is deleted: the approval and its evidence stay exactly as they were.

**How hard the fences hold.** `strict` leaves all five fences up. `relaxed` lowers plan approval and review freeze. `off` lowers those two plus state transition and reviewer scope. No value lowers human presence, and a lowered fence still writes an audit row every time it lets something through.

No value removes a gate. Every approval question is still asked, a reviewer's verdict is never changed, no evidence is deleted, an agent can never answer for you, and editing the approved plan itself (or its test instructions or Testing Contract) reopens approval under all three values. Guard Policy decides the consequence of a change or an undirected action, not whether the framework notices it.

#### Defaults per scope

| Scope | Default |
|-------|---------|
| enterprise, security-patch, infra | strict |
| poc, express, classic, bugfix, feature, mvp, refactor, workshop | relaxed |

No shipped scope defaults to `off`; it is something you ask for. A composed scope carries the value the composer proposed and you approved at its gate; a matched stock scope carries that scope's default.

#### The three places to set it

1. **The scope file.** `guard_policy: strict | relaxed | off` in `scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` is the value every new intent on that scope starts with. Every shipped scope declares it; a scope file that declares none starts strict.
2. **Memory.** A `## Guard Policy` section with one line, `Mode: strict`, in `aidlc/spaces/<space>/memory/org.md`, `team.md`, or `project.md` holds strict for everyone on the repo. It wins over the scope default and per-intent values. An explicit `--guard-policy relaxed` or `--guard-policy off` is refused with a sentence naming the file, and none of the command's companion settings or scope change is applied. `Mode: relaxed`, `Mode: off`, or an empty section changes nothing; any other value is a validation error naming the file and the three allowed values.
3. **The intent.** `/aidlc --guard-policy strict|relaxed|off`, `/aidlc config set guard-policy <value>`, or a plain-chat request such as "stop asking me to re-approve when files change" uses the shared `config-change` setter for the running piece of work (`/aidlc --status` shows it as `Guard Policy: relaxed (set by you)`). It can be combined with the other setting flags in the same transaction.

#### Where the value lives

The resolved value is written to the intent's `aidlc-state.md` at creation as `- **Guard Policy**: <value> (from scope <name>)`, rewritten by the flag or the chat request, and read by value only. Because the state file is committed with the intent, the value survives sessions and teammates see the same one; a memory edit that changes the effective value for a running intent is recorded as a `GUARD_POLICY_SET` row naming the memory file the next time a governed check runs. An intent created before this field existed stays `strict (not set)` until you set it; an invalid field is unavailable until `/aidlc --guard-policy` with one of the three values repairs it. The next intent starts from its scope's default again.

#### This setting used to be called Change Control

Every old spelling still works in this release and is removed in the next minor version: the scope key `change_control`, the state field `Change Control`, the memory heading `## Change Control`, the flag `--change-control`, and the config key `change-control`. Typing the retired flag or config key prints one line naming the new spellings; a retired scope key, state field, or memory heading is read without comment. Nothing writes an old name again: a state file still carrying a `Change Control` line has that line renamed in place the next time the setting is written, so the setting never appears twice. The `CHANGE_CONTROL_SET` audit event stays readable in older ledgers; new rows are `GUARD_POLICY_SET`.

### The five fences

A fence is a guard that refuses an action nothing asked for: no step the workflow is currently running calls for it. Each fence can be switched off for one piece of work and switched back on.

| Fence | What it refuses | Config key | Machine-wide kill switch |
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Plan approval | code before an approved plan | `guard.plan-approval` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD=1` |
| Review freeze | edits to reviewed content after a review receipt | `guard.review-freeze` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEW_FREEZE_HOOK=1` |
| State transition | direct lifecycle commands in place of the workflow's own | `guard.state-transition` | none |
| Reviewer scope | a reviewer agent writing outside the Unit it was given | `guard.reviewer-scope` | `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEWER_SCOPE_HOOK=1` |
| Human presence | an approval or an answer with no real human turn behind it | `guard.human-presence` | `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1` |

```
/aidlc config set guard.plan-approval off
/aidlc config set guard.plan-approval on
```

Switching one off writes `- **Guards Off**: plan-approval (set by you)` into `aidlc-state.md` and one `GUARD_DISABLED` audit row; switching it back on writes `GUARD_RESTORED`. The line names only what you lowered, so it is easy to see what is down and put it back, and `/aidlc --status` prints a `Fences:` line with all five and where each setting came from. For one fence the order of precedence is the machine-wide kill switch, then your per-work switch, then the Guard Policy word, then on.

A fence is lowered by a switch and by nothing else. Typing something in the session does not lower one, however clearly you meant it: the framework can tell that you spoke, but not what you asked for, and a fence that opened on any keystroke would be no fence at all. When one holds, the refusal names the switch, so opening it is one deliberate move rather than a guess about your intent.

Human presence is the strictest of the five. It is what makes your approval yours, so no Guard Policy value lowers it: only its own switch or its kill switch can.

### Who asked for this: the authority chain

Every action a guard sees is classified before anything is decided. Is it covered by something you said, by the workflow's own instruction, or by neither?

- **Your grant.** A message you sent after the workflow last told the agent what to do. It covers everything done to carry that message out, including work by any agent dispatched for it, and it lasts until the workflow issues its next instruction.
- **The workflow's instruction.** The stage the engine currently has in force. It covers the work that instruction asks for, whoever does it, including an approval still pending inside it. It does not cover the loop skipping one of its own steps, which is exactly what a fence notices.
- **Neither.** Something outside the instruction with nothing from you since: the narrowest cover, and the one an unreadable signal falls back to.

The question is never who is typing. A developer agent acts on the conductor's word and the conductor acts on yours, so authority flows down the chain: when the conductor dispatches an agent, the authority in force at that moment is stamped on the dispatch and the agent inherits it. An agent can never mint a grant for itself, and an unreadable signal narrows what is covered rather than widening it. The signals are ones the framework already keeps: the turn markers under `.aidlc-engine/` that record your last prompt against the workflow's last advancing command, the counters on the active-directive marker, and the dispatch stamp on the in-flight agent ledger.

What this classification decides is the changed-input question above: under `strict`, a grant is what lets the framework ask you about the change instead of stopping and waiting for the next boundary. It does NOT lower a fence. Its other job is the record: every time a lowered fence lets something through, the audit row names the authority in force, so a reader can see who was working when it happened.

### What you see when a guard decides

- **It stands aside.** One line, and the work continues: `Continuing past the plan-approval check because it is off for this piece of work. Recorded in the audit trail: <detail>`. One `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` row records the fence, the authority in force, how a grant was proven, and whether the actor was the main session or a dispatched agent. You are never asked "are you sure": the switch is already off.

  You see that line on Claude Code, Codex, opencode, and Kiro CLI. On Kiro IDE you do not: the IDE hands a hook's output to the agent only at session start and at prompt submit, so a stand-aside there is silent and the audit row is the only record of it. Every hook refusal reason is already invisible on that harness for the same reason. The row is written only when the intent already has an audit trail, so on a brand-new project with no ledger yet a stand-aside leaves neither the line nor the row. If you want to know what a lowered fence let through, read the `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` rows in the intent's `audit/` shards rather than relying on having seen the line.
- **It holds.** The refusal says what is missing and adds one sentence naming the way through: `If you meant to do this now, turn the check off for this piece of work with /aidlc config set guard.plan-approval off. It is recorded, and it comes back on for the next piece of work.`
- **It asks.** Under `strict`, an input that changed after you approved something is asked about once, naming what changed.

---

## Stage Customization

Each stage is a self-contained `.md` file in `.claude/aidlc-common/stages/[phase]/`. Stage files specify:

- **Metadata** — Stage number, phase, execution mode, lead/support agents
- **Inputs** — Prior artifacts to load
- **Steps** — Numbered execution sequence
- **Outputs** — Artifacts to produce
- **Completion** — Approval gate pattern

To modify a stage's behavior, edit its stage file directly. All stages reference the stage protocol for shared patterns (approval gates, question format, state tracking).

### Depth levels

Each scope has a default depth that controls artifact detail:

| Depth | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Brief artifacts, targeted analysis, no optional content |
| **Standard** | Balanced detail, covers primary and secondary concerns |
| **Comprehensive** | Full detail, extensive analysis, all optional content included |

You can override depth at any approval gate by requesting a different level.

---

## Statusline (Claude Code only)

On **Claude Code**, this implementation displays a statusline in the terminal status bar showing workflow progress. The other harnesses have no statusline — they surface workflow position through `/aidlc --status` (Kiro, Cursor, opencode) and the `update_plan` task-progress item plus `$aidlc --status` (Codex):

```
[AIDLC] IDEATION [▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░] 4/7 > Intent Capture -- Product Agent
```

This shows, in order: current phase, phase progress (as a bar and a ratio — both scoped to the current phase), stage display name, and lead agent. Context usage appears on the right (e.g., `ctx:15%`), color-coded as the remaining context drops. When the Claude usage ledger has data, `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>` follows for the active workflow and current transcript/session only; prior workflows and sessions are excluded. Setting `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1` turns usage tracking off entirely and removes this segment.

### Configuration

The statusline is configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bun \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tools/aidlc.ts\" engine statusline"
}
```

### Customizing the format

Edit `.claude/hooks/aidlc-statusline.ts` directly. The output format is defined in the `main()` function near the end of the file. The hook reads phase, stage, and agent from `aidlc-state.md`, maps stage slugs to display names, and builds both the unicode progress bar and the `n/m` ratio from the same phase-local checkbox parse.

### Disabling the statusline

Remove the `statusLine` block from `settings.json`. The terminal status bar reverts to Claude Code's default.

---

## Tool Permissions

The `permissions.allow` list in `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves Claude Code tools so workflows run without per-call permission prompts:

```json
"permissions": {
  "allow": [
    "Read", "Edit", "Write",
    "Bash(bun .claude/tools/*)",
    "Bash(date -u *)",
    "Glob", "Grep", "Task", "WebSearch"
  ]
}
```

The copy channel pre-approves `Bash(bun .claude/tools/*)`; the native release rewrites that entry to `Bash(aidlc engine *)`. `Bash(date -u *)` covers the timestamps the protocol asks the conductor to take. There is no bare `Bash`: Claude Code matches every subcommand of a compound command on its own and strips only a fixed set of known-safe environment variables, so an engine command stays pre-approved only when it runs bare. A `cd ... &&` prefix, an absolute `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` path, a `VAR=1` prefix, a pipe into `jq`, or a `$(...)` capture all prompt. A project's own build and test commands sit outside the list and prompt once; answering "Yes, and don't ask again" saves a rule for them in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### How permissions work

- **Project-wide ceiling**: The `settings.json` allow list is the maximum set of tools available
- **Claude Code agents inherit the full session toolset** by default; `disallowedTools: Task` blocks nested subagent spawning on this harness
- **Optional per-agent narrowing**: An agent can be narrowed by adding a `tools:` allowlist to its frontmatter — omit it to inherit everything. Listing `tools:` drops inherited MCP tools unless the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids are also listed

### Expanding permissions

Only add tools to the allow list if you create custom stages that need additional capabilities.

### Narrowing permissions

Remove tools from the allow list to require manual approval for each use. Note that removing `Task` causes the four dispatched stages (2.1 Reverse Engineering pipeline, 2.2 Practices Discovery subagent, 2.4 User Stories mob, 3.5 Code Generation subagent) to prompt for permission on each delegation. Workspace detection (0.2) runs deterministically inside `aidlc-utility intent-create` — it does not use `Task`.

## Extending AI-DLC

The settings, scopes, depth, and stage edits above cover day-to-day tuning of a workflow you run. When you want to reshape the framework itself for your team — add a stage, add an agent, define a scope, teach a standing rule, wire a deterministic check, or add domain knowledge — that's a distinct job with its own guide: the **[Harness Engineer Guide](../harness-engineering/00-overview.md)**.

The dividing line is data versus code. Everything in that guide is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter or a JSON config that the framework reads — no TypeScript edits. Where to go for each extension:

| You want to… | Start at |
|--------------|----------|
| Edit what a stage does, or add a new stage | [Anatomy of a Stage](../harness-engineering/01-anatomy-of-a-stage.md), [Adding a Stage](../harness-engineering/02-adding-a-stage.md) |
| Add or modify an agent | [Adding an Agent](../harness-engineering/03-adding-an-agent.md) |
| Define or tune a scope | [Scopes](../harness-engineering/04-scopes.md) |
| Teach a standing rule, or operate the learning loop | [Rules and the Learning Loop](../harness-engineering/05-rules-and-the-loop.md) |
| Wire a deterministic check (sensor) into a stage | [Sensors](../harness-engineering/06-sensors.md) |
| Add team domain knowledge | [Team Knowledge](../harness-engineering/07-team-knowledge.md) |

If your change is to the framework's *code* — the orchestrator, a hook, a CLI tool, the compile pipeline — that's the [Developer Reference](../reference/00-overview.md).
